#
#   1. host services — mock payment rail (127.0.0.1:8780, HOST ONLY), the
#      release gate SUBMIT listener (127.0.0.1:8790; the sandbox reaches it only
#      via the host.openshell.internal route in policy.yaml), and the host-only
#      APPROVE listener (127.0.0.1:8791; the sandbox has no route to it)
#   2. optional local image sanity build — OpenShell builds the real image
#      itself from the recipe-root Dockerfile via --from in phase 3; this is
#      only a fast local fail-early check and is skipped without docker
#   3. sandbox — `openshell sandbox create --from <recipe-root>` with
#      policy.yaml applied WHOLE (inference routes + blackwall advisory routes +
#      release-gate SUBMIT route; no rail route, no approve route). This is what
#      the security boundary needs: verify.sh exercises the denied edge via
#      `sandbox exec` and does NOT require the Hermes agent runtime to be up.
#      NOTE: --from takes the recipe ROOT (the Dockerfile's directory), because
#      OpenShell uses that directory as the Docker build context and the
#      Dockerfile COPYs from recipe-root-relative paths (agents/, scripts/).
#
# Requires: python3. openshell for phase 3 (and docker only for the optional
# phase-2 sanity build); without them the host boundary still comes up and
# scripts/verify.sh --host-only can exercise it.
