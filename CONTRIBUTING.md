# Contributing to NemoClaw Community

Thank you for your interest in improving NemoClaw Community.

This repository contains NemoClaw examples and developer tools. You can deploy
each example independently.

By participating, you agree to follow our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues or pull requests.
Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Ways to Contribute

Use one of these methods to contribute:

- Improve an example or its documentation.
- Fix setup, checks, teardown, or sandbox lifecycle problems.
- Add or improve agent skills, policies, integrations, or developer tools.
- Contribute a new example.
- Report a reproducible problem.

For a problem report, identify the example. Give the environment details.

Select an example from the [example catalog](examples/README.md). Read the
example's README. Follow all linked setup and check instructions.

Discuss each of these changes with maintainers before implementation:

- A major feature or scope change.
- A new dependency.
- A distribution change.
- Publication of a container image.
- A change to the project license or compliance requirements.

For more information, read [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Classify Issues And Pull Requests

Use native GitHub Issue Type for issue classification. Select `Bug` for broken
behavior, `Enhancement` for a new capability, `Task` for maintainer work, and
`Documentation` for missing or incorrect documentation. Labels route work; they
do not replace native Issue Type.

Use a Conventional Commit-style title for issues and pull requests:

```text
<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>
```

Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, and
`perf`. Examples include `feat(gitlab): add policy-scoped read access`,
`fix(outlook): reuse the refresh-token cache`, and `docs: clarify setup`.

Read the canonical
[maintainer taxonomy](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-maintainer-policies/references/label-taxonomy.md)
before suggesting or applying labels. New example proposals and publication
pull requests also follow the repository's example-kind and provenance labels.

## Prerequisites

Install these tools before you run repository checks:

- Git.
- Python 3.10 or newer. Use the `python3` command.

Some examples require a newer Python version, additional software, credentials,
or external service access. The software can include Docker, `uv`, Helm, or
Bash.

Follow the prerequisites in the README for each example that you modify.

## Create a Fork and Branch

If you do not have write access to the NVIDIA repository, first create a fork
on GitHub.

Use these commands to clone your fork and create a branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
git fetch upstream main
git checkout -b <short-branch-name> upstream/main
```

Use this command to push the branch to your fork:

```bash
git push -u origin <short-branch-name>
```

Before you open or update a pull request, refresh the upstream reference:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
```

If the example uses a Git submodule, initialize the submodule as specified in
the example's README. You do not need to initialize submodules for unrelated
examples.

## Work Within an Example

This repository does not have one shared runtime setup. Each example defines
its own development and verification workflow.

Follow the selected example's instructions for these items:

- Prerequisites and supported environments.
- Credentials and secret handling.
- Setup and configuration.
- Sandbox, network, and policy permissions.
- Startup and shutdown.
- Verification and tests.
- Cleanup and teardown.
- Known limitations.

Keep each example independently deployable. Do not make an example depend on
private files, internal systems, or local state from another example.

## Contribution Requirements

Limit each pull request to one feature, fix, documentation update, or
coordinated migration.

Apply these conditional requirements:

- When behavior changes, add or update tests.
- When setup, configuration, policy, permissions, or user-visible behavior
  changes, update the documentation.
- If the change does not require a third-party dependency, do not add one.
- When dependencies or distributed third-party content change, update
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES).

Apply these requirements to all pull requests:

- Preserve partner and community attribution, including names and credits.
- Use placeholders for private values in public configuration and
  documentation.
- Do not commit secrets, local `.env` files, private certificates, token
  caches, generated snapshots, generated runtime state, or private workspace
  details.
- Do not add internal-only links to public documentation.

Use these rules during checks:

- If the change does not require an external system for a check, do not contact
  that system.
- If the change does not require a live service for a check, do not start that
  service.
- Before you contact an external system or start a live service, confirm that
  you have the required credentials and authorization.

## Check Your Changes

After you commit your changes, run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_license_headers.py --check
git fetch upstream main
git diff --check upstream/main...HEAD
```

If you have unstaged changes, also run this command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

If you have staged but uncommitted changes, also run this command:

```bash
git diff --cached --check
```

These commands do not replace example-specific verification. For each changed
example, run the checks that its README specifies.

Run the documented setup, syntax, unit, configuration, and teardown-safe checks.
A stable check gives the same result when its inputs do not change. A
teardown-safe check does not leave services or temporary resources active.

Use the smallest stable check that shows the changed behavior.

In the pull request description, include this check information:

- The exact commands that you ran.
- The result of each command.
- The verification that you did not complete and the reason.
- The required live, hardware-specific, credentialed, or external-system
  verification that remains.

Before you report that a check passed, run it after the last change that can
affect its result.

When adding, moving, or renaming an example, follow the
[example taxonomy and naming policy](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-contributor-examples/references/example-taxonomy.md)
and its linked restructure checklist.

## Add a New Example

Before implementation, discuss the example's location, name, and provenance
with the maintainers. Provenance identifies the example's origin, history,
contributors, and contributor organizations.

Document this information for a new example:

- Its purpose, intended users, and support boundary.
- Its contributor or organizational provenance.
- Its prerequisites and supported environments.
- Its architecture and major components.
- Its credential and secret handling.
- Its setup and configuration.
- Its sandbox, network, and policy permissions.
- Its startup behavior.
- Its verification steps and expected results.
- Its teardown and cleanup.
- Its known limitations.
- Its third-party dependencies and license obligations.

Add the example to the [example catalog](examples/README.md).

## Move or Rename an Example

Before you move or rename an example, complete these steps:

- Search the repository for the old path and name.
- Search open pull requests for the old path and name.
- Identify affected pull requests and downstream documentation.
- Record the merge order.
- Coordinate the rebase sequence with owners of dependent pull requests.
- Keep path changes separate from unrelated runtime or dependency changes.

In the pull request for the move, complete these steps:

- Add a table that maps each old path to its new path.
- Update links, commands, ownership, notices, and `.gitmodules` entries.
- List identifiers that must keep an old name for compatibility.
- Give instructions for existing clones if a submodule moves.
- Verify each moved example from its new location.
- Remove obsolete paths.

After the migration merges, owners of dependent pull requests must fetch the
updated `main` branch from `upstream`. Then, each owner must rebase the pull
request branch onto `upstream/main`.

After each rebase, confirm that the pull request does not restore an obsolete
path.

## Sign Off Every Pull Request

Every pull request description must include a
[`Signed-off-by:` declaration](https://developercertificate.org/) for Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO) compliance. The pull request author must add the
declaration before requesting review.

Add this line to the pull request description:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Use your own name and email address. Individual commits may also include
sign-off trailers, but the required check validates the declaration in the pull
request description. The example name and email address do not satisfy the
required check.

DCO sign-off is separate from cryptographic commit signing.

Maintainers do not accept pull requests without the required declaration.

## Open a Pull Request

Complete [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Your pull request should include:

- The problem and expected result.
- The examples and repository areas that the change affects.
- The exact check commands and results.
- An explanation for checks that you did not run.
- The documentation and dependency changes.
- For a migration, its details and downstream follow-up work.
- Your DCO sign-off declaration.

Submit all changes to `main` through a pull request.

Maintainers merge a pull request only when all these conditions are true:

- The pull request description satisfies the DCO requirement.
- The pull request satisfies the license-header requirements.
- The pull request has no unresolved review conversations.
- A maintainer approves the pull request.

Maintainers review and merge contributions according to
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

Maintainers may require NVIDIA internal open-source review for these changes:

- A major scope change.
- A new dependency.
- A distribution scope change.
- Publication of a container image.
- A material change to the project license or compliance surface.
