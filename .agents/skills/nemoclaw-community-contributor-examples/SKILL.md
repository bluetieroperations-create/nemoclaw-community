# NemoClaw Community Contributor Examples

Use this skill to keep the example catalog navigable as it grows without
changing an example's runtime or security boundaries accidentally.

## Workflow

1. Read [references/example-taxonomy.md](references/example-taxonomy.md).
   For issue and pull request metadata, also read the canonical
   [maintainer taxonomy](../nemoclaw-community-maintainer-policies/references/label-taxonomy.md).
2. Read the target example's README and nearby deployment documentation before
   classifying or naming it.
3. Select the artifact type first. For recipes, select contributor provenance
   second. Use an outcome-oriented leaf name.
4. When moving or renaming an existing example, also read
   [references/restructure-checklist.md](references/restructure-checklist.md)
   and inventory every repository reference before editing.
5. Preserve contributor attribution, deployment behavior, security policy,
   credential handling, teardown behavior, and Compose/Helm parity.
6. Update the public catalog, repository links, contribution commands, notices,
   submodule configuration, and external-document follow-ups in the same
   change.
7. Run the smallest relevant example checks, then the repository-wide checks
   required by `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Boundaries

- Treat directory placement as navigation, not a support or maturity promise.
- Do not classify provenance from technology usage alone. Require explicit
  attribution or repository history.
- Do not broaden egress, permissions, credential exposure, host access, or
  agent authority as part of a catalog change.
- Do not retain duplicate compatibility directories. Document path migrations
  and update callers.
- Ask maintainers when ownership or artifact type remains ambiguous after
  inspecting the example.
