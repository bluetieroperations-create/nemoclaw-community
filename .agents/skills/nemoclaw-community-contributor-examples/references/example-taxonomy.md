# Example Taxonomy And Naming

This is the canonical placement and naming policy for content under
`examples/`.

## Principles

- Classify first by artifact type: recipe, demo, launchable, or tool.
- For recipes, classify second by contributor provenance.
- Encode stable navigation in paths. Keep mutable attributes such as maturity,
  supported versions, integrations, and deployment status in documentation.
- Use directory placement for discovery, not as a support-level claim.
- Keep each example independently deployable.

## Directory Structure

```text
examples/
├── recipes/
│   ├── nvidia/
│   ├── partners/<organization>/
│   └── community/
├── demos/
│   └── field/
├── launchables/<environment>/
└── tools/
```

Git does not preserve empty directories. Create a category when its first
example lands; document reserved categories in `examples/README.md`.

## Classification

| Type | Use when | Do not use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recipes` | The example is a complete, reusable agent workflow intended for adaptation. | It is primarily a presentation script, environment bootstrap, or development utility. |
| `demos/field` | The artifact is optimized for a bounded field demonstration on named hardware or software. | It is intended as a reusable enterprise workflow. |
| `launchables` | The artifact's primary purpose is provisioning or onboarding in a specific environment. | The environment is only one deployment option for a broader recipe. |
| `tools` | The artifact is a standalone developer or evaluation utility rather than a deployed agent blueprint. | It produces the end-user agent workflow itself. |

## Recipe Provenance

| Path | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `recipes/nvidia/` | Authored or maintained by NVIDIA and allowed to include documented NVIDIA-specific assumptions. |
| `recipes/partners/<organization>/` | Explicitly contributed by the named external organization. Preserve its attribution. |
| `recipes/community/` | Contributed independently without formal organizational provenance. |

Using an NVIDIA model, GPU, SDK, or service does not by itself make a recipe an
NVIDIA recipe. Determine provenance from explicit README attribution or
repository history.

## Naming

- Use lowercase kebab-case.
- Name the outcome, operational role, or scenario.
- Do not repeat `recipe`, `demo`, `nemoclaw`, or the contributor when the parent
  path already supplies that context.
- Include a platform, harness, or hardware name only when it materially defines
  portability or the established example identity.
- Do not put versions, lifecycle states, or temporary initiatives in paths.
- Avoid narrow task labels when an example performs a broader workflow.

Prefer `developer-community-chief-of-staff` over
`personal-community-sentiment-triage`: the former describes the workflow's
coordination and intelligence outcome rather than one analysis technique.

## Current Catalog Mapping

| Example | Canonical path |
| --- | --- |
| Developer Community Chief of Staff | `examples/recipes/nvidia/developer-community-chief-of-staff/` |
| Payment Operations Hermes Assistant | `examples/recipes/nvidia/payment-ops-hermes/` |
| HPE Retail Assistant | `examples/recipes/partners/hpe/retail-assistant/` |
| Tavily Watchtower | `examples/recipes/partners/tavily/watchtower/` |
| DGX Station Blender and Omniverse | `examples/demos/field/blender-omniverse-dgx-station/` |
| Hermes Brev Launchable | `examples/launchables/brev/hermes/` |
| Harness Engineering Playground | `examples/tools/harness-engineering-playground/` |

## Public Repository Boundary

NVIDIA-authored does not mean NVIDIA-internal. Public examples must use
placeholders, omit private tenant and workspace details, and contain no
internal-only links. Document private deployment overlays outside this public
repository.
